This is part 3 of the Analysis Services DevOps blog series. [Go to part 2](https://tabulareditor.github.io/2019/06/28/DevOps2.html)

## Automation Magic with Azure Pipelines

[Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops) is the service within Azure DevOps, that lets us automate our builds and deployments. In short, there are two kinds of pipelines in Azure DevOps: Build Pipelines, which are used to validate code and produce build artifacts, and Release Pipelines, which take an artifact from a build pipeline and deploys it to one or more environments.

For an Analysis Services project, you can think of the Model.bim file as an artifact, as it contains all the model metadata necessary to deploy the project somewhere. For other project types, you would have different artifacts: An SQL Server Database Project (SSDT) would use a .dacpac file, an Integration Services project would use an .ispac file, and so on.

Within a pipeline, you define a series of tasks to perform the operations needed. Azure DevOps offers a lot of standard tasks out-of-the-box, with specific functionality for common build and deployment scenarios. A lot of these task are related to web and mobile application development. If you search the marketplace, there's also a couple of free 3rd party tasks related to Analysis Services. For this blog series, however, we will mostly use the standard (Windows) Command line task and the [Tabular Editor CLI](https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/wiki/Command-line-Options), in order to validate code within source control, produce a Model.bim file, and then deploy it to an instance of Analysis Services.

The examples provided here, are easily converted to PowerShell if that's what you prefer.

### Pipeline Agents

An [Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops) is the service application that executes the steps defined in our pipelines. Before we set up a new pipeline in Azure DevOps, we have to decide where this application should run. If our Analysis Services project is going to be deployed on an on-premises instance of SQL Server Analysis Services, we will have to run the service application from a location that can actually access that instance. In this scenario, we will have to install the Agent software on an on-premises machine (self-hosting). Specifically, we need a Windows machine to host the Agent software, as TabularEditor.exe can only be executed on Windows. To download and install the Agent software locally, go to "Project settings" > "Agent pools" > Choose the "Default" pool > "New agent":

From here, follow the instructions on the screen, to download, install and configure the agent. Once that's done, you should see the self-hosted agent correctly registered within Azure DevOps, in the "Default" agent pool:

If using Azure Analysis Services, we can choose one of the Microsoft-hosted agent pools instead. These are agents that run on Microsoft Azure VMs, and as such, they will only be able to connect to instances of Analysis Services that are reachable from the cloud. You get a single hosted agent with 1800 minutes of pipeline executions pr. month for free with Azure DevOps. Take a look at the [Service Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/) to learn what other options are available.

Note, that we can still decide to use a self-hosted agent even if our entire BI solution is running in the cloud.

### Making TabularEditor.exe available for an agent

In order for our pipelines to use TabularEditor.exe, we must make sure that the application is available on the machine hosting the agent. For a self-hosted agent, it's only a matter of installing Tabular Editor on the same machine, and (optionally) registering the location of Tabular Editor within the path variable on that machine, to make executions easier. Since the self-hosted agent will run in the context of a local system service account, we need to make sure that we amend the PATH variable at the system scope. To do this, run the following command as an administrator, on the machine hosting the agent:

```
setx /M PATH "%PATH%;c:\Program Files (x86)\Tabular Editor\"
```

(making sure the specified path points to the location of Tabular Editor on that machine)

### Tabular Editor on Microsoft-hosted agents

On Microsoft-hosted agents, we can't preinstall any software, so one option to make sure that TabularEditor.exe (and its required dependencies) is available for our pipelines, is to copy the entire installation into source control (.exe file + the Microsoft DLLs). This will ensure that you can execute TabularEditor.exe on the Microsoft-hosted machine when running a build pipeline. However, executing TabularEditor.exe as part of the release pipeline will be a little more tricky, as there's no default step that copies the files from source control and into the working directory. This means that you would have to either include TabularEditor.exe and its dependencies as part of your build pipeline artifact, or manually create a step within your release pipeline to copy the files from source control.

As of [Tabular Editor version 2.8.4](https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/releases/tag/2.8.4), all releases will now contain a portable version (.zip) of Tabular Editor which includes the redistributable DLLs, in addition to the installer version (.msi). So a much better way to ensure the availability of Tabular Editor on your build agent, is to
