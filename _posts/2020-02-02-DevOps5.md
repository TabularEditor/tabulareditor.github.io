This is part 5 of the Analysis Services DevOps blog series. [Go to part 4](https://tabulareditor.github.io/2019/10/17/DevOps4.html)

## Release Pipelines

In the previous chapter, we saw how to set up a complete build pipeline, that loads our Tabular model from source control, performs a schema check, runs the best practice analyzer and even performs a validation deployment. At the end, the build pipeline saves and publishes a Model.bim file as an artifact. You can think of this artifact as the "compiled" version of our model, even though it is still just a .json file. The point is, that we can take this file and deploy it anywhere.

To actually perform the deployment to various environments (Dev, UAT, Prod, etc.), we are going to use the concept of [Release Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/?view=azure-devops) in Azure DevOps.

A release pipeline uses the artifact produced by one or more build pipelines, to perform the actual deployment to one or more so-called "Stages". Each stage represents an environment such as Dev, UAT, Prod, etc. You can define as many stages as you need, and you can set up triggers between the stages. For example, you can enable automatic deployment to UAT once deployment to Dev succeeds. Or you can set up pre-deployment approval on a stage, such that someone should manually approve the deployment before it is started.

In the screenshot below, we have 3 environments. Deployment to Dev is triggered automatically whenever a new build artifact has been created. Deployment to Test is triggered automatically once deployment to Dev succeeds. Deployment to Prod is triggered once deployment to Test succeeds **and** someone approves the deployment. For this specific scenario, we set it up such that only the team lead could approve deployments to Prod:

Release pipelines can be configured in many different ways, so I leave it up to you to decide how best to taylor them to the needs of your team. Ideally, you want to set up a single release pipeline that can deploy your entire BI solution (infrastructure, database project, ETL, tabular model, etc.) across all environments. For the purposes of this article, however, we will focus on how to deploy tabular models only.

Within each stage in your release pipeline, you can define a number of tasks similar to your build pipelines. You can define pipeline variables that have different values depending on which stage is being executed, making it easy to reuse scripts, command line tasks, etc. across all stages.

### Creating your first Release Pipeline

To create a new release pipeline, go to Pipelines > Releases > Click "New" and choose "New Release Pipeline" > Start with an **Empty Job**. You should then be presented with a screen that looks like this:

<img width="526" alt="Screenshot 2020-02-12 at 10 25 21" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8976200/74321082-fe40c900-4d81-11ea-81f5-9a1de5e6c760.png">

Click "Add an artifact" and choose the build pipeline you created in [chapter 4](https://tabulareditor.github.io/2019/10/17/DevOps4.html) as the Source. Click "Add". Then, it's time to define your stages. Click on "Stage 1" and change its name to "Dev" or whatever else you would like to call the first environment in your release pipeline. Don't add any additional stages just yet - it's easier to clone the "Dev" stage once we have defined all the tasks it needs.

Next up, let's define our pipeline variables. Click on the "Variables" tab and add the following variables. For now, only supply the values for the first stage (Dev):

- **ASConnectionString**: Connection string of the Analysis Services instance you want to deploy to.
- **ASDatabase**: Name of the database you want to deploy on the Analysis Services instance.
- **SQLDWConnectionString**: Connection string to be used for the Data Source object inside your Tabular model. That is, the SQL Server connection that your Tabular model will connect when refreshing data.

Click on the "Tasks" tab and choose the "Dev" stage. You'll be presented with an interface that is very similar to the one used for defining build pipelines in chapter 3 and 4.

<img width="1033" alt="Screenshot 2020-02-12 at 11 22 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8976200/74326042-06046b80-4d8a-11ea-91ce-731ea27f0c2f.png">

The tasks we add here, will be executed whenever a release to the Dev stage is performed. First, let's add a PowerShell task for downloading Tabular Editor. You can use an inline script or point to a script stored in your repository. For reference, here's the code that will download a specific version of Tabular Editor from GitHub (we used the same code in chapter 3):

```powershell
# Download URL for Tabular Editor portable:
$TabularEditorUrl = "https://github.com/otykier/TabularEditor/releases/download/2.9.2/TabularEditor.Portable.zip" 

# Download destination (root of PowerShell script execution path):
$DownloadDestination = join-path (get-location) "TabularEditor.zip"

# Download from GitHub:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $TabularEditorUrl -OutFile $DownloadDestination

# Unzip Tabular Editor portable, and then delete the zip file:
Expand-Archive -Path $DownloadDestination -DestinationPath (get-location).Path
Remove-Item $DownloadDestination
```

Next up, add a Command Line task, which will use Tabular Editor to update the connection string within the model and deploy to the target instance of Analysis Services. No need to run schema checks, best practice analyzer, etc. here, since we already did that in our build pipeline, so we know that the build artifact is good and ready for deployment. However, we do still need to execute a script on our .bim file, to ensure that the Data Source inside our model gets updated to point to the correct SQL database. Tabular Editor scripts cannot be defind inline when calling TabularEditor.exe - we have to supply a file containing the script. Thus, we have three options available:

- We can generate the script file in a separate command line step.
- We can add another artifact to our release pipeline, based on our Git repository.
- We can ensure that the script is published as part of the artifact we created in the build pipeline.

The best practice approach, is to revisit our build pipeline to ensure that the script gets added to the same artifact as the Model.bim file. This way, we can treat an artifact as a complete "build package" containing everything we need to deploy our model. This is left as an exercise for the reader (hint: Use a "Copy Files Task" to copy your script to `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` before publishing the artifact).

Assuming your model only contains a single data source, and the only property we want to change is the connection string, the script is a very simple one-liner:

```csharp
(Model.DataSources[0] as ProviderDataSource).ConnectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SQLDWConnectionString");
```

This script assigns the value contained in the environment variable `%SQLDWConnectionString%`
```
```

The Command Line task is similar to the Validation Deployment we did in [chapter 4](https://tabulareditor.github.io/2019/10/17/DevOps4.html#step-3---validation-deployment), only this time, we use the build artifact as the source for deployment:

TabularEditor.exe "AdventureWorks.bim" -S "$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\AdventureWorks\scripts\SetConnectionStringFromEnv.cs" -D "%ASConnectionString%" "$(ASDatabase)" -O -C -P -R -M -V -E -W
