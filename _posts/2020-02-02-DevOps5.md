This is part 5 of the Analysis Services DevOps blog series. [Go to part 4](https://tabulareditor.github.io/2019/10/17/DevOps4.html)

## Release Pipelines

In the previous chapter, we saw how to set up a complete build pipeline, that loads our Tabular model from source control, performs a schema check, runs the best practice analyzer and even performs a validation deployment. At the end, the build pipeline saves and publishes a Model.bim file as an artifact. You can think of this artifact as the "compiled" version of our model, even though it is still just a .json file. The point is, that we can take this file and deploy it anywhere.

To actually perform the deployment to various environments (Dev, UAT, Prod, etc.), we are going to use the concept of [Release Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/?view=azure-devops) in Azure DevOps.

A release pipeline uses the artifact produced by one or more build pipelines, to perform the actual deployment to one or more so-called "Stages". Each stage represents an environment such as Dev, UAT, Prod, etc. You can define as many stages as you need, and you can set up triggers between the stages. For example, you can enable automatic deployment to UAT once deployment to Dev succeeds. Or you can set up pre-deployment approval on a stage, such that someone should manually approve the deployment before it is started.

In the screenshot below, we have 3 environments. Deployment to Dev is triggered automatically whenever a new build artifact has been created. Deployment to Test is triggered automatically once deployment to Dev succeeds. Deployment to Prod is triggered once deployment to Test succeeds **and** someone approves the deployment. For this specific scenario, we set it up such that only the team lead could approve deployments to Prod:

Release pipelines can be configured in many different ways, so I leave it up to you to decide how best to taylor them to the needs of your team. Ideally, you want to set up a single release pipeline that can deploy your entire BI solution (infrastructure, database project, ETL, tabular model, etc.) across all environments. For the purposes of this article, however, we will focus on how to deploy tabular models only.

Within each stage in your release pipeline, you can define a number of tasks similar to your build pipelines. You can define pipeline variables that have different values depending on which stage is being executed, making it easy to reuse scripts, command line tasks, etc. across all stages.

### Creating your first Release Pipeline

To create a new release pipeline, go to Pipelines > Releases > Click "New" and choose "New Release Pipeline" > Start with an **Empty Job**. You should then be presented with a screen that looks like this:
